# AWS SageMaker Data Wrangler and EDA

AWS SageMaker Data Wrangler is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. It provides a visual interface to analyze, clean, and transform data without requiring extensive coding. Here's how it can help you with EDA:

---

## **1. Data Import and Exploration**
- **Connect to Multiple Data Sources**: Import data from Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, or other supported sources.
- **Data Preview**: View a sample of your dataset to understand its structure, column types, and values.
- **Statistical Summaries**: Automatically generate descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns and frequency counts for categorical columns.

---

## **2. Data Cleaning**
- **Handle Missing Values**: Identify and fill missing values with mean, median, or custom values.
- **Remove Duplicates**: Detect and remove duplicate rows in your dataset.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify and handle outliers using statistical methods.

---

## **3. Data Visualization**
- **Built-in Visualizations**: Create histograms, scatter plots, box plots, line charts, and more to understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Custom Visualizations**: Use Python or R scripts to create custom visualizations directly within the interface.

---

## **4. Data Transformation**
- **Feature Engineering**: Perform operations like one-hot encoding, normalization, and scaling.
- **Custom Transformations**: Write custom Python or R scripts for advanced transformations.
- **Data Splitting**: Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

---

## **5. Data Insights**
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify relationships between features using correlation matrices.
- **Target Variable Analysis**: Analyze the relationship between features and the target variable to identify important predictors.

---

## **6. Integration with SageMaker**
- **Export Data**: Save the cleaned and transformed dataset to Amazon S3 for further use.
- **Pipeline Integration**: Export the entire data preparation workflow as a SageMaker pipeline for automation and reproducibility.

## **Example Workflow in SageMaker Data Wrangler**
1. **Import Data**: Load your dataset from Amazon S3.
2. **Visualize Data**: Create histograms and scatter plots to understand distributions and relationships.
3. **Clean Data**: Handle missing values and remove duplicates.
4. **Transform Data**: Normalize numerical features and encode categorical variables.
5. **Export Data**: Save the processed dataset to Amazon S3 for model training.
