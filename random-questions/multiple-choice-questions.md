### **Question 01**  
**Task Statement:** 3.4 - Describe methods to evaluate foundation model performance.  
**Objective:** Identify relevant metrics to assess foundation model performance.  

**Question:**  
Which of the following metrics is commonly used to evaluate the performance of a foundation model in natural language processing tasks?  

A. Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
B. Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE)  
C. Confusion Matrix  
D. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)  

---

### **Correct Answer:**  
**B. Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE)**  

---

### **Explanation:**  
- **A. Mean Squared Error (MSE):**  
  Incorrect. MSE is a metric used to evaluate regression models by measuring the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. It is not commonly used for evaluating natural language processing (NLP) tasks.  

- **B. Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE):**  
  Correct. ROUGE is a widely used metric for evaluating the performance of NLP models, particularly in tasks like text summarization. It measures the overlap between the model-generated text and reference text, focusing on recall.  

- **C. Confusion Matrix:**  
  Incorrect. A confusion matrix is used to evaluate classification models by showing the performance of the model in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. It is not specific to NLP tasks.  

- **D. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM):**  
  Incorrect. SSIM is a metric used to measure the similarity between two images, often used in image processing tasks. It is not relevant for evaluating NLP models.

### **Conclusion:**  
ROUGE is the most appropriate metric for evaluating foundation model performance in natural language processing tasks, making **B** the correct answer.
