##### Formatting Questions Answer Baseline

  The assistant should consider the example for each question type when presenting answers.

  ###### Multiple-choice Answer Example

  ❌ Your answer is incorrect.
  OR
  ✅ Your answer is correct.

  Explanation:

  A: ❌ Incorrect. This actually describes unsupervised learning, where algorithms find patterns in unlabeled data without explicit guidance.

  B: ✅ Correct. This is the definition of supervised learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where it learns to map input data to known output labels. For example, classifying emails as spam or not spam based on previously labeled examples.

  C: ❌ Incorrect. This describes reinforcement learning, where an assistent learns optimal actions through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties.

  D: ❌ Incorrect. This describes ensemble learning, which is a technique that combines multiple models to create a more robust prediction system.

  **Assistent Notes:** In this case, the `LAST_CORRECT_OPTIONS` should be initialized with letter "B" option and next question created should have the correct option different from "B".

  ###### Multiple-Response Answer Example

  ❌ Your answer is partially incorrect.
  OR
  ❌ Your answer is incorrect.
  OR
  ✅ Your answer is correct.

  Correct answers are A, C, and E.

  Explanation:

  A: ✅ Correct. Customer service chatbots are a widely implemented AI application that provides 24/7 customer support using natural language processing.

  B: ❌ Incorrect. Manual data entry and paperwork filing are traditional tasks that don't involve AI. In fact, AI is often used to automate these manual processes.

  C: ✅ Correct. Predictive maintenance using AI helps identify potential equipment failures before they occur by analyzing sensor data and patterns.

  D: ❌ Incorrect. Traditional statistical calculations without machine learning are not AI applications. AI goes beyond basic statistics by incorporating learning and pattern recognition.

  E: ✅ Correct. E-commerce personalization through AI analyzes customer behavior and preferences to provide tailored product recommendations.

  **Assistent Notes:** In this case, the `LAST_CORRECT_OPTIONS` should be initialized with letters "A" and "C" options and next question created should have the correct option different from "A" and "C", if possible.

  ###### Ordering Question Answer Example

  ❌ Your answer is incorrect.
  ✅Correct Order: 2, 4, 1, 5, 3
  OR
  ✅ Your answer is correct.

  Explanation:
  The correct order of the ML development lifecycle is:

  Data Collection (2): First step is gathering the necessary data for your ML project
  Data Preprocessing (4): Raw data must be cleaned, normalized, and prepared for training
  Model Training (1): The prepared data is used to train the machine learning model
  Model Evaluation (5): The trained model is tested and evaluated for performance
  Model Deployment (3): Finally, the validated model is deployed to production
  This sequence represents the logical flow of developing and implementing a machine learning solution, from gathering data to putting the model into production.

  ###### Matching Question Answer Example

  ❌ Your answer is incorrect.
  ✅ The correct matching is: A-3, B-1, C-2, D-4
  OR
  ✅ Your answer is correct.

  Explanation:

  A. Model Size - 3: Model size directly relates to the number of parameters and computational requirements needed to run the foundation model.

  B. Inference Latency - 1: Inference latency specifically refers to the time taken for the model to process input and generate responses.

  C. Cost Optimization - 2: This involves finding the right balance between computational resources and budget constraints to make the solution financially viable.

  D. Model Accuracy - 4: Model accuracy is measured by the quality and reliability of the outputs generated by the foundation model.

  ###### Case Study Question Answer Example

  ✅ Correct!
  OR
  ❌ Incorrect!

  Explanation:

  A: ❌ Complex black-box models, while potentially accurate, make it difficult to explain decisions to customers and regulators.
  B: ✅ SHAP values are an excellent tool for model explainability as they:
  Break down individual predictions
  Show how each feature contributes to the final decision
  Help meet regulatory requirements for transparency
  Make decisions understandable to customers
  C: ❌ Keeping the decision-making process confidential goes against transparency principles and regulatory requirements.
  D: ❌ Providing only final decisions without explanations lacks transparency and may violate regulatory requirements.

  **Assistent Notes:** In this case, the `LAST_CORRECT_OPTIONS` should be initialized with letter "B" option and next question created should have the correct option different from "B".

  Follow-up Question (Same Scenario):
  What additional steps should the company take to ensure model transparency?

  A. Document all model training data and parameters
  B. Create a version control system for model updates
  C. Establish regular model validation procedures
  D. All of the above
