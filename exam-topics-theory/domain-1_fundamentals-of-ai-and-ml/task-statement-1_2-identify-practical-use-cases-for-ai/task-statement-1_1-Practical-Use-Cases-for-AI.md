# Task Statement 1.2 Identify Practical Use Cases for AI

# Practical Use Cases for AI

## Overview

AI technology offers significant advantages in automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, and solving complex problems. However, it is important to evaluate when AI is appropriate and when alternative solutions may be more effective.

---

## Suitable Use Cases for AI

- **Automating Repetitive Tasks**
  - AI can handle repetitive and tedious tasks continuously without a decrease in performance.
  - Reduces employee workload and streamlines business operations.

- **Solving Complex Problems**
  - Utilizes machine learning (ML) and deep learning to address problems requiring humanlike intelligence.
  - Effective for analyzing vast amounts of data at high speed.

- **Pattern Recognition and Anomaly Detection**
  - Excels at recognizing patterns and detecting deviations, such as fraud detection.
  - Useful for uncovering irregularities in large datasets.

- **Forecasting and Resource Optimization**
  - AI can forecast demand for products or resources, helping to reduce waste.
  - Enables companies to make better decisions and improve efficiency.

- **Enhancing Customer Experience**
  - Supports businesses in addressing customer needs more effectively.

## Limitations and Considerations

- **Resource Consumption**
  - Training AI models requires significant processing power and resources.
  - Frequent retraining may be necessary, increasing costs.

- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**
  - The benefits of AI should outweigh the costs.
  - Example: Estimate the savings from fraud and waste reduction and compare them to the cost of building and maintaining the AI model.

- **Model Interpretability**
  - Complex models, such as neural networks, may lack transparency.
  - Interpretability is crucial for decisions impacting customers, such as loan approvals.

- **Tradeoff: Performance vs. Interpretability**
  - More complex models offer higher performance but lower interpretability.
  - Business or compliance requirements for transparency may necessitate simpler models, potentially reducing performance.

## Alternatives to AI

- **Rule-Based Systems**
  - Suitable when determinism and transparency are required.
  - Example rule: Approve loans automatically for applicants with a credit score above 750 for amounts up to $10,000.
  - Rule-based applications are deterministic, always producing the same output for the same input unless rules are changed.

- **Deterministic vs. Probabilistic Systems**
  - Rule-based systems are deterministic.
  - Machine learning models are probabilistic, incorporating randomness and learning over time, which can lead to varying outputs for identical inputs.
  - If consistent, repeatable results are necessary, rule-based systems are preferable.
