# Practical Use Cases for AI

## Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

- **MasterCard International Inc.**
  - Utilizes AI to score each transaction for fraud probability.
  - Trained fraud detection models with SageMaker, resulting in:
    - Tripling the number of detected fraudulent transactions.
    - Reducing false positives by a factor of 10.
  - In 2024, integrated generative AI to improve fraud detection by an average of 20%.
  - Large language models analyze customer transaction history to predict the likelihood of a transaction being legitimate.

## Natural Language Processing in Customer Service

- **DoorDash**
  - Replaced a touch-tone interactive voice response (IVR) system with a natural language processing solution using Amazon Lex.
  - Enabled customers to interact using speech instead of button presses.
  - Outcomes:
    - Improved customer experience.
    - Decreased hold times.
    - Increased self-service adoption.

## Real-Time Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance

- **Laredo Petroleum**
  - Operates over 1,300 oil and gas wells equipped with pressure, temperature, and flow rate sensors.
  - Implemented a data streaming solution and built machine learning models with Amazon SageMaker for real-time monitoring.
  - Benefits:
    - Enables proactive maintenance.
    - Rapid identification and remediation of operational issues.
    - Reduces environmental impact by preventing flaring or venting of natural gas.
    - Deployed models for leak detection in storage tanks and corridor lines.

## Personalized Recommendations and Generative AI in Travel

- **Booking.com**
  - Manages over 28 million accommodation listings and 150 petabytes of data.
  - Uses Amazon SageMaker to build machine learning models for booking recommendations.
  - Developed the AI Trip Planner application:
    - Engages customers using natural language.
    - Utilizes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide up-to-date recommendations by querying booking APIs and retrieving customer reviews.

## Visual Search and Product Discovery

- **Pinterest**
  - Hosts billions of images for over 450 million users.
  - Offers Pinterest Lens, a feature that allows users to take a picture of an object and receive similar product suggestions.
  - Maintains a large collection of labeled product images in Amazon S3.
  - Frequently re-trains machine learning models to recognize new objects.
  - Uses Amazon Mechanical Turk and SageMaker Ground Truth for image labeling.
