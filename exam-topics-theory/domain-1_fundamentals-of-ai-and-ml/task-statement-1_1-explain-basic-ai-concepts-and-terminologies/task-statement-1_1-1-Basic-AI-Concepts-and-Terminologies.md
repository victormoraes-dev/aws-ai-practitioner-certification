# Basic AI Concepts and Terminologies

---

## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
- **Definition:** Artificial intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science dedicated to solving cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence, such as learning, creation, and image recognition.
- **Goal:** The goal of AI is to create self-learning systems that derive meaning from data.

### Examples of AI in Action
- **Conversational AI:** Systems can respond meaningfully to questions and create original content (text, images).
- **Data Processing:** AI can process vast quantities of data quickly, enabling solutions for complex problems like real-time fraud detection.
- **Automation:** AI performs repetitive and monotonous tasks, increasing business efficiency and freeing employees for creative work.
- **Pattern Recognition & Forecasting:** AI excels at finding patterns in data and forecasting trends, helping businesses make smarter decisions and react quickly.

## What is Machine Learning (ML)?
- **Definition:** Machine learning is a branch of AI and computer science that focuses on using data and algorithms to imitate the way humans learn, gradually improving accuracy.
- **How it Works:** ML models are trained using large datasets to identify patterns and make predictions.
- **Example:** Product recommendations for online shoppers.

## AI Techniques
- **Regression Analysis:**
  - AI models process historical (time series) data to predict future values.
  - Example: Forecasting store customer volume to schedule staff.
- **Inference:**
  - AI predictions are called inferences (probabilistic results, not certainties).
- **Anomaly Detection:**
  - AI detects deviations from expected patterns (e.g., sudden drop in call center activity).

## Computer Vision
- **Applications:**
  - Object identification, facial recognition, classification, monitoring, and detection in images and video.
- **Examples:**
  - Detecting scratches on surfaces.
  - Identifying missing components on circuit boards.

## Language and Translation
- **Text Translation:**
  - AI translates text between languages, analyzing context for accurate communication.
- **Real-Time Translation Example:**
  - Customer support chat: Real-time translation between different languages.

---

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Definition:** NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language naturally.
- **Applications:**
  - Powers voice assistants, chatbots, and booking assistants.
- **Example:**
  - Chatbot prompts customer for reservation information.

---

## Generative AI
- **Definition:** Generative AI can have intelligent conversations and generate original content (stories, images, videos, music).
- **Example:**
  - A prompt can generate a complete song with verses, chorus, bridge, and outro.
