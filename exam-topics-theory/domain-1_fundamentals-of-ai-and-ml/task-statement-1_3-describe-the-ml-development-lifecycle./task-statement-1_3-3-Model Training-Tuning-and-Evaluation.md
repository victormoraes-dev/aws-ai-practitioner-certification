# ML Development Lifecycle: Model Training, Tuning, and Evaluation

## Model Training

- **Training Process**
  - The machine learning algorithm updates parameters (weights) to minimize the error between predicted and expected outputs.
  - Training is an iterative process, where weights are adjusted based on previous outputs to reduce error.
  - The process continues until a set number of iterations is reached or the change in error falls below a defined threshold.

- **Experimentation**
  - Multiple algorithms and configurations are evaluated in parallel to identify the best-performing solution.
  - Each algorithm has hyperparameters (external parameters) that influence performance, such as the number of neural layers or nodes in deep learning models.
  - Optimal hyperparameter values are determined by running multiple experiments with different settings.

## Model Training Workflow

1. **Prepare Training Job**
   - Specify the location of training data.
   - Define compute resources for training.
   - Set the output location for model artifacts.
   - Choose the algorithm by providing the path to a container image (pre-built or custom).
   - Set required hyperparameters.

2. **Run Training Job**
   - Launch compute instances.
   - Execute training code using the specified dataset and algorithm.
   - Save resulting model artifacts and outputs.

## Experiment Management

- **Experiment Tracking**
  - Track and manage multiple training runs with different data, algorithms, and parameters.
  - Analyze and compare runs based on key performance metrics.
  - Identify the best-performing models through systematic experimentation.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

- **Automatic Model Tuning**
  - Run multiple training jobs with different hyperparameter values to optimize model performance.
  - Specify the algorithm, hyperparameter ranges, and performance metric to optimize.
  - The tuning process continues until the completion criteria are met (e.g., no further improvement in the metric).

- **Example: Binary Classification Tuning**
  - Optimize hyperparameters to maximize a metric such as the area under the curve (AUC).
  - The tuning job iteratively tests combinations of hyperparameters and selects the best-performing configuration.

## Key Concepts

- Iterative experimentation is essential for improving model accuracy.
- Hyperparameter tuning automates the search for optimal model configurations.
- Systematic management and comparison of experiments enable efficient model development and selection.
