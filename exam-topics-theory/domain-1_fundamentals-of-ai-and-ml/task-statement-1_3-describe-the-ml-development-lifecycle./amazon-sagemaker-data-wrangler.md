## Key Features

### **Access, Select, and Query Data Faster**
- Quickly access tabular, text, and image data from Amazon services such as S3, Athena, Redshift, and 50+ third-party sources.
- Select data using a visual query builder, write SQL queries, or import data directly in formats like CSV and Parquet.

### **Generate Data Insights and Understand Data Quality**
- Automatically verify data quality (e.g., missing values, duplicate rows, data types).
- Detect anomalies such as outliers, class imbalance, and data leakage.
- Generate data quality and insights reports to apply domain knowledge effectively.

### **Understand Your Data with Visualizations**
- Built-in visualization templates such as histograms, scatter plots, feature importance, and correlations.
- Intuitive data quality reports to detect anomalies and provide recommendations for improving data quality.

### **Transform Data More Efficiently**
- Over 300 prebuilt PySpark transformations and a natural language interface for preparing tabular, timeseries, text, and image data without coding.
- Common use cases include text vectorization, datetime featurization, encoding, data balancing, and image augmentation.
- Author custom transformations in PySpark, SQL, and Pandas or use the natural language interface to generate code.
- Built-in library of code snippets simplifies writing custom transformations.

### **Understand the Predictive Power of Your Data**
- Quick Model analysis to estimate your data's predictive power.
- Provides estimated model accuracy, feature importance, and a confusion matrix to validate data quality before training models.

### **Automate and Deploy ML Data Preparation Workflows**
- Scale to prepare petabytes of data without coding PySpark or spinning up clusters.
- Launch processing jobs directly from the UI or integrate data preparation into ML workflows.
- Export data to SageMaker Feature Store or integrate with SageMaker Pipelines.
- Export data flows as Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for programmatic replication of data preparation steps.
