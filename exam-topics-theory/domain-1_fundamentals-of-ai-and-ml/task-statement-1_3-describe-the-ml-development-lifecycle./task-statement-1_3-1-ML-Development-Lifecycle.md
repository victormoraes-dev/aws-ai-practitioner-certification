# Task Statement 1.3 Describe de ML Development Lifecycle

# ML Development Lifecycle

## Overview

The machine learning (ML) development lifecycle consists of a series of interconnected steps that begin with a business goal and conclude with the operation of a deployed ML model. The process is iterative, with many steps repeated as objectives are refined and new data becomes available.

## ML Pipeline Phases

1. **Define the Problem and Business Goal**
   - Identify the business problem to be solved.
   - Establish measurable business objectives and success criteria.
   - Align stakeholders and gain consensus on project goals.
   - Evaluate if ML is the appropriate solution by considering accuracy, cost, and scalability.

2. **Data Collection and Preparation**
   - Ensure the availability of relevant, high-quality training data.
   - Evaluate and access correct data sources.
   - Formulate the ML problem in terms of inputs, desired outputs, and performance metrics.

3. **Solution Evaluation**
   - Investigate all available options, starting with the simplest solution.
   - Perform a cost-benefit analysis to determine project viability.
   - Consider pre-built AI services for common use cases.

4. **Model Selection and Customization**
   - Evaluate hosted AI services that provide pre-trained models (e.g., Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Bedrock).
   - Customize outputs or fine-tune models using transfer learning if necessary.
   - Use open-source pre-trained models for jumpstarting development (e.g., Amazon SageMaker).

5. **Model Training**
   - Fine-tune pre-trained models with custom data when required.
   - Train custom models from scratch only if pre-trained or hosted solutions do not meet objectives.
   - Consider the increased responsibility for security and compliance when training from scratch.

6. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the trained model to a production environment.
   - Ensure the deployment process aligns with business and technical requirements.

7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Continuously monitor model performance against business and technical metrics.
   - Retrain models with new data as needed.
   - Monitor for data drift and bias, and adjust or rebuild models as necessary.

## AWS Services for ML Pipeline Stages

- **Amazon Comprehend**: Custom classifiers using user-supplied training data.
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Foundation models for generative AI, with support for fine-tuning via transfer learning.
- **Amazon SageMaker**: Open-source pre-trained models and tools for model development and deployment.
- **SageMaker JumpStart**: Pre-trained AI foundation models and task-specific models for computer vision and natural language processing, with options for incremental training.

## Key Considerations

- Begin with clear business objectives and measurable success criteria.
- Evaluate the simplest and most cost-effective solutions first.
- Use pre-trained or hosted models when possible to reduce cost and development time.
- Only train custom models from scratch when necessary, considering the additional complexity and responsibility.
- Continuously monitor and maintain deployed models to ensure ongoing business value.
