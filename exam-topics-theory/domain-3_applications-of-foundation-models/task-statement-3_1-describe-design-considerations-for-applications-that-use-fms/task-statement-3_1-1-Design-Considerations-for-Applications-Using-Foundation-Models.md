# Task Statement 3.1: Describe Design Considerations for Applications that Use Foundation Models

# Design Considerations for Applications Using Foundation Models

## Selection Criteria for Pre-Trained Models

When designing applications that use foundation models, consider the following selection criteria:

- **Cost**: Evaluate the cost of training, deploying, and maintaining the model. Balance model accuracy with budget constraints.
- **Modality**: Determine the required data modalities (e.g., text, image, audio) and whether the model supports them.
- **Latency**: Assess the inference speed and whether the model can meet real-time or near-real-time requirements.
- **Multilingual Support**: Consider if the model needs to handle multiple languages.
- **Model Size and Complexity**: Analyze the number of parameters, layers, and operations, as these affect speed, memory usage, and accuracy.
- **Customization**: Evaluate the ability to fine-tune or adapt the model to specific tasks or datasets.
- **Input and Output Length**: Ensure the model can handle the required input and output sizes for your application.

## Cost Considerations

- Training and maintaining large models can be expensive due to hardware, storage, and operational costs.
- Weigh the tradeoff between model accuracy and cost. For example, a model with 98% accuracy may be significantly more expensive than one with 97% accuracy.
- Aim for a scalable and efficient solution that meets performance requirements without unnecessary expense.

## Latency and Inference Speed

- Applications with real-time requirements must prioritize models with fast inference times.
- Complex models may have higher accuracy but slower inference, which may not be suitable for time-sensitive applications.
- Example: Self-driving vehicle systems require instant decisions; models with slow inference times are unsuitable.

## Modalities

- Each modality (text, image, audio, etc.) may require specific model architectures or embeddings.
- Ensemble methods can combine multiple models to improve performance.
- Multilingual models should be considered if the application requires support for multiple languages.

## Model Architecture and Complexity

- Different architectures are suited for different tasks:
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Best for image recognition.
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Suitable for natural language processing.
- Model complexity, measured by parameters and layers, impacts speed, memory, and accuracy.
- More complex models generally offer higher accuracy but require more resources.

## Performance Metrics

- Use standard metrics to evaluate and compare models:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1 Score**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- Select metrics relevant to the specific task. For example, MAP is preferred for object detection, while accuracy may not be suitable for imbalanced datasets.
