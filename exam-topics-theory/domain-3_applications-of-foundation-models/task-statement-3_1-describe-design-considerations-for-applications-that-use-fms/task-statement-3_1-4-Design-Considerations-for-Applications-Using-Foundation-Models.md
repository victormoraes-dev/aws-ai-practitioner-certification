# Task Statement 3.1: Describe Design Considerations for Applications thet Use Foundation Models

# Design Considerations for Applications That Use Foundation Models

## Inference Parameters and Model Responses

- **Inference**: The process of generating an output from an input provided to the model.
- **Prompt**: The input given to the model to generate a response.
- **Inference Parameters**: Adjustable values that influence the model's response characteristics.

### Common Inference Parameters

- **Temperature**: Controls the randomness of the output. Higher values increase randomness, while lower values make responses more deterministic.
- **Top K**: Limits the model to consider only the top K most probable next tokens.
- **Top P (Nucleus Sampling)**: Considers the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold P.
- **Response Length**: Sets the maximum length of the generated response.
- **Penalties**: Adjusts the likelihood of repeating tokens or phrases.
- **Stop Sequences**: Defines sequences that, when generated, will stop further output.

> **Best Practice**: Experiment with different parameter settings to find the optimal balance between diversity, coherence, and resource efficiency. Continuously monitor and adjust these parameters in production to maintain optimal performance.

## Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

- **Prompt**: A specific set of inputs provided by the user to guide the model in generating an appropriate response.
- **Contextual Data**: Additional domain-specific or internal data can be integrated into prompts to enrich responses.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: A method that augments prompts with semantically relevant data retrieved from external sources, such as vector databases.

## Vector Databases vs. Machine Learning Models

- **Vector Database**: Stores data as mathematical representations (embeddings) of structured and unstructured data (e.g., text, images).
  - **Embeddings**: Numerical representations that capture the meaning and relationships of data.
  - **Functionality**: Enables efficient and fast lookup, data management, fault tolerance, authentication, access control, and query capabilities.
  - **Use Case**: Serves as a factual reference for foundation model applications, enhancing search, recommendations, and text generation.

- **Machine Learning Model**: Used to generate embeddings that populate vector databases. The model is a prerequisite for creating and indexing data in a vector database.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

- **Definition**: A technique where information retrieved from external data sources augments the generation of model responses.
- **Purpose**: Enhances language models by enabling them to use external knowledge during the response generation process.
- **Application**: Used in knowledge bases to collect and utilize data sources for improved model output.

## Key Considerations

- Select inference parameters that align with project objectives and resource constraints.
- Use prompt engineering and RAG to improve the relevance and accuracy of model responses.
- Understand the distinction and relationship between vector databases and machine learning models for effective data management and retrieval in AI applications.
