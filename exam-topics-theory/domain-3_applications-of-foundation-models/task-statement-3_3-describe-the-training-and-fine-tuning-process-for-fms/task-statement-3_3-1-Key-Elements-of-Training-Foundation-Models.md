# Task Statement 3.3: Describe the Training and Fine-Tuning Process for Foundation Models

## Key Elements of Training Foundation Models

- **Pre-training**
- **Fine-tuning**
- **Continuous Pre-training**

---

## Pre-Training

- Involves training generative AI models using massive computational resources (millions of GPU hours, terabytes/petabytes of data, trillions of tokens).
- Utilizes self-supervised learning on large amounts of unstructured data (documents, videos, images, audio files).
- Enables the model to learn fundamental language and knowledge representations.

---

## Fine-Tuning

- Extends the training of a pre-trained model to improve performance on specific tasks.
- Uses supervised learning with labeled datasets to update model weights.
- Adapts foundation models to custom datasets and use cases.
- **Instruction-based fine-tuning**: Uses labeled examples to improve performance on targeted tasks.

### Single-Task Fine-Tuning

- Improves performance for a specific task.
- Risk: **Catastrophic Forgetting** â€“ fine-tuning for one task may degrade performance on others.
- Consideration: If only single-task performance is required, catastrophic forgetting may be acceptable.

### Full Fine-Tuning

- Updates every parameter in the model through supervised learning.
- Requires significant compute and memory resources (model parameters, optimizer, gradients, activations, temporal memory).

---

## Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

- Freezes most of the original model parameters and fine-tunes a small set of task-specific adaptor layers.
- Reduces compute and memory requirements.
- **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: Inserts trainable low-rank matrices into each transformer layer, preserving original weights.

---

## Representation Fine-Tuning (ReFT)

- Freezes the base model and learns task-specific interventions on hidden representations.
- Based on the linear representation hypothesis: concepts are encoded in linear subspaces of neural network representations.

---

## Multitask Fine-Tuning

- Uses datasets with examples for multiple tasks (e.g., summarization, translation, ratings).
- Produces instruction-tuned models capable of handling various tasks simultaneously.
- Updates model weights using losses calculated from multiple task examples.
- Helps mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

---

## Domain Adaptation Fine-Tuning

- Adapts pre-trained models to domain-specific data using limited specialized datasets.
- Useful for incorporating industry jargon, technical terms, or specialized language.
- Improves model performance in specific domains.

---

## Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

- Fine-tunes models using reinforcement learning with human feedback data.
- Aligns model outputs with human preferences and improves response quality to human-like prompts.
