# Task Statement 3.3: Describe the Training and Fine-Tuning Process for Foundation Models

## Data Preparation for Fine-Tuning

### Steps for Data Preparation
- **Collect and preprocess raw data** for model training.
- **Organize data** into appropriate formats for model consumption.
- **Divide the dataset** into training, validation, and test splits.

### Prompt Template Libraries
- Utilize prompt template libraries for various tasks and datasets to structure instruction datasets.

### Data Splitting
- **Training Set:** Used for model learning and weight updates.
- **Validation Set:** Used to evaluate model performance during training and tune hyperparameters.
- **Test Set:** Used for final performance evaluation after training.

## Fine-Tuning Process

1. **Select prompts** from the training dataset and pass them to the language model to generate completions.
2. **Compare the model's completions** with the training labels to calculate a loss between the two token distributions.
3. **Update model weights** using the calculated loss to improve task performance.
4. **Evaluate performance** using the validation dataset to obtain validation accuracy.
5. **Perform final evaluation** using the test dataset to obtain test accuracy.

## Data Preparation Options

### Low-Code Data Preparation
- Use tools to create data flows for ML data pre-processing with minimal coding.

### Scalable Data Preparation
- Use open-source frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, or Presto for large-scale data processing.
- Integrate with managed services for distributed data processing.

### Serverless Data Preparation
- Use serverless engines based on Apache Spark for aggregating, transforming, and preparing data from multiple sources.

### SQL-Based Data Preparation
- Use SQL interfaces in notebook environments for data manipulation and preparation.

### Feature Discovery and Storage
- Use feature stores to search, discover, and retrieve features for model training.
- Store feature data in a centralized, standardized format.

### Bias Detection
- Use tools to analyze data and detect potential biases, such as imbalanced representations or labeling biases across groups.

### Data Labeling
- Use data labeling workflows to manage and annotate training datasets.

## Continuous Pre-Training

- **Purpose:** Enhance model capabilities by training on diverse data over time.
- **Benefits:** Improves adaptability and knowledge accumulation, enabling better handling of out-of-domain data.
- **Validation:** Requires careful selection of metrics, benchmarks, and datasets to ensure model quality and prevent harmful outputs.

## Summary

- Data preparation is a critical step in the fine-tuning process, involving collection, preprocessing, organization, and splitting of data.
- Fine-tuning involves iterative training, evaluation, and weight updates to adapt foundation models to specific tasks.
- Continuous pre-training further enhances model performance and adaptability by exposing models to a broader range of data.
