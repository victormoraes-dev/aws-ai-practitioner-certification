# Task Statement 3.4: Describe Methods to Evaluate Foundation Models Performance

## Considerations for Model Integration and Deployment

- Assess model performance requirements for deployment environments (on-premises, cloud, edge).
- Key questions:
  - What is the required inference speed?
  - What is the available compute budget?
  - Are trade-offs between model performance, inference speed, and storage acceptable?
- Common deployment challenges:
  - Compute and storage limitations
  - Low-latency requirements

## Optimization Techniques

- Reduce model size to decrease inference latency (may impact performance).
- Use concise prompts and limit the size and number of retrieved snippets.
- Adjust inference parameters and prompt length to optimize generation.
- Balance between accuracy and performance based on application needs.

## Evaluation Metrics for Foundation Models

### Deterministic Models

- Metrics such as accuracy and root mean square error (RMSE) are straightforward to calculate.

### Generative AI Models

- Outputs are non-deterministic, making evaluation more complex and task-specific.

#### Common Metrics

- **ROUGE (Recall Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):**
  - Used for automatic summarization and machine translation.
  - Compares overlap between generated and reference outputs.
- **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy):**
  - Used for evaluating machine translation quality.
  - Measures correspondence between machine output and human reference.

## Benchmarks for Model Evaluation

- **GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation):**
  - Collection of natural language tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, question answering).
  - Measures model generalization across tasks.
- **SuperGLUE:**
  - Extension of GLUE with additional tasks (e.g., multi-sentence reasoning, reading comprehension).
- **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding):**
  - Evaluates knowledge and problem-solving across diverse domains (history, mathematics, law, computer science).
- **BIG-bench (Beyond the Imitation Game Benchmark):**
  - Focuses on tasks beyond current language model capabilities (math, biology, physics, bias, linguistics, reasoning, software development).
- **HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models):**
  - Combines metrics for summarization, question answering, sentiment analysis, and bias detection.
  - Aims to improve model transparency and guide task-specific model selection.

## Human Evaluation

- Manual comparison of model responses by human evaluators.
- Useful for subjective or nuanced tasks where automated metrics may be insufficient.

## Automated Evaluation Tools

- Tools can create model evaluation jobs to assess and compare model quality and metrics for text-based foundation models.
- Evaluation modules may automatically compare generated responses and calculate semantic similarity scores (e.g., BERTscore) against human references.
- Suitable for evaluating faithfulness and detecting hallucinations in text-generation tasks.

## Summary

- Model evaluation involves both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments.
- Selection of evaluation methods and benchmarks should align with the specific application and deployment requirements.
- Optimization and trade-offs are necessary to balance performance, speed, and resource constraints.
