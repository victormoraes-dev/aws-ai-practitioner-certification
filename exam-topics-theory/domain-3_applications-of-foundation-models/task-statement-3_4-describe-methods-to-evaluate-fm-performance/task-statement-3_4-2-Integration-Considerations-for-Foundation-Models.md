# Task Statement 3.4: Describe Methods to Evaluate Foundation Models Performance

## Integration Considerations for Foundation Models

- Assess additional resources required by the model.
- Determine if the model needs to interact with external data or applications.
- Plan how to connect the model to external resources.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

- RAG is a framework for LLM systems to access external data sources.
- Addresses the challenge of outdated internal model knowledge.
- Provides context to reduce hallucinations and improve factuality.
- Reduces the need for frequent re-training by enabling access to up-to-date information at inference time.
- Requires configuration to connect LLMs to external components and manage data flow.

## High-Level Stack for Generative AI Applications

### Key Questions

- How will the model be consumed?
- What is the design of the application or API interface?
- How does the model meet business objectives (e.g., productivity, user engagement, task engineering)?

### Steps for Building and Evaluating Generative AI Applications

1. **Define Business Goals**
   - Identify the specific problem to solve.
   - Determine success metrics.

2. **Establish Infrastructure**
   - Provide compute, storage, and network resources for hosting LLMs and application components.
   - Ensure security across the AI lifecycle (data preparation, training, inference).

3. **Model and Storage Selection**
   - Choose appropriate large language models and infrastructure for inference needs.
   - Plan for additional storage if collecting user completions or feedback for fine-tuning or evaluation.
   - Isolate and secure data.

4. **Tools and Frameworks**
   - Utilize tools and frameworks for managing LLMs.
   - Use model hubs for centralized model management and sharing.

5. **User Interface and API Layer**
   - Develop user interfaces (e.g., website, REST API) for application consumption.
   - Implement security for user interactions.
   - Support real-time or near real-time interactions as required.
   - Integrate with external data sources (e.g., RAG) if needed.
   - Store outputs and user feedback for ongoing evaluation and alignment.

## End-to-End Solution Components

- **Infrastructure Layer:** Compute, storage, network, and security.
- **Model Layer:** Selection and deployment of LLMs, additional storage for outputs and feedback.
- **Tools/Frameworks Layer:** Management and sharing of models.
- **Interface Layer:** User interfaces, APIs, and security for application consumption.

## Monitoring and Evaluation

- Measure, monitor, and review defined metrics to evaluate model and application performance.
- Collect and store user feedback for continuous improvement and alignment with objectives.
