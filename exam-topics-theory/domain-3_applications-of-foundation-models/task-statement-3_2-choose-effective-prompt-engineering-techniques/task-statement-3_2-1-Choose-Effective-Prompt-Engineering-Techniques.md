# Task Statement 3.2: Choose Effective Prompt Engineering Techniques

# Choose Effective Prompt Engineering Techniques

## Prompts and Their Components

- **Prompt Definition**: A prompt is a specific set of inputs provided to a large language model (LLM) to guide it in generating an appropriate response or output for a given task or instruction.
- **Components of a Prompt**:
  - **Task or Instruction**: The action or objective for the LLM.
  - **Context**: Background information or situational details relevant to the task.
  - **Input Text**: The data or content to be processed or responded to.

Depending on the use case, data availability, and task requirements, a prompt may combine one or more of these components.

## Prompt Engineering Techniques

- **Zero-Shot Prompting**: 
  - No examples are provided.
  - The model is expected to perform the task based solely on the instruction.
  - Example: Sentiment classification prompt without examples.

- **Few-Shot Prompting**:
  - A few examples are included in the prompt.
  - Helps the model calibrate its output to better meet expectations.

- **Prompt Templates**:
  - Predefined structures that may include instructions, few-shot examples, and specific content or questions.
  - Useful for standardizing prompts across different use cases.

- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**:
  - Breaks down the reasoning process into intermediate steps.
  - Improves the quality and coherence of the final output, especially for complex tasks.

- **Prompt Tuning**:
  - The prompt text is replaced with a continuous embedding that is optimized during training.
  - Only the prompt embedding is updated, while the rest of the model parameters remain frozen.
  - More efficient than full model fine-tuning for specific tasks.

## Principles of Prompt Engineering

- **Crafting and Optimizing Prompts**:
  - Select appropriate words, phrases, sentences, punctuation, and separator characters.
  - The quality of prompts directly impacts the quality of LLM responses.

- **Strategy Selection**:
  - The choice of prompt engineering strategy depends on the task and the data involved.

## Common Tasks Supported by LLMs

- Classification
- Question and Answer (with and without context)
- Summarization
- Open-ended Text Generation
- Code Generation
- Math and Reasoning
- Logical Thinking

## Model Latent Space

- **Latent Space**: The encoded knowledge of language within an LLM, representing stored patterns and relationships in the data.
- **Function**: When prompted, the model reconstructs language and generates outputs based on these patterns.
- **Example**: A model trained on scuba vacation data can recommend destinations by referencing its latent space, which contains statistical representations of various features (e.g., destination, dive depth, visibility, water temperature).
