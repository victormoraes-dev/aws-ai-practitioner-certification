# Task Statement 5.2: Recognize Governance and Compliance Regulations for AI Systems

# Governance and Compliance Regulations for AI Systems

## Overview

Concerns about the risks of AI have led to the development of several compliance standards for AI workloads. Adhering to these standards helps protect businesses and customers, and ensures fairness in decision-making. Industry-specific standards may also apply, and regular audits or inspections are necessary to confirm compliance.

## Shared Responsibility Model

- **AWS Shared Responsibility Model**: 
  - **AWS Responsibilities**: Securing the underlying physical data centers and infrastructure, and meeting compliance requirements of the cloud.
  - **Customer Responsibilities**: Securing workloads in the cloud to meet compliance requirements.

## Compliance Certifications and Attestations

- **AWS Compliance**: 
  - Maintains rigorous security and compliance certifications and attestations for data center operations, technology, and security.
  - Compliance standards include security and operational controls tested and validated by external auditors.

- **Examples of Compliance Standards**:
  - **SOC Reports**: 
    - Service Organization Controls (SOC) reports verify that third parties follow specific best practices.
    - SOC 2 reports cover security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
    - Customers use AWS SOC 2 reports as a foundation for their own compliance efforts.
  - **ISO 27001**: 
    - International security management standard specifying best practices and comprehensive security controls.
    - AWS certification assists customers in achieving their own ISO 27001 certification.
