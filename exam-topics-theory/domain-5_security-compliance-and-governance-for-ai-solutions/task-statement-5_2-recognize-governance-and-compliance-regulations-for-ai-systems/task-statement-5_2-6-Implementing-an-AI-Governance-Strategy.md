# Task Statement 5.2: Recognize Governance and Compliance Regulations for AI Systems

# Governance and Compliance Regulations for AI Systems

## Implementing an AI Governance Strategy

### 1. Identify Scope of Responsibility
- Define the areas of responsibility, which may include:
  - Governance and compliance
  - Legal and privacy
  - Risk management
  - Security controls
  - Model resilience

### 2. Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix
- The level of responsibility increases with the degree of AI customization:
  - **Scopes 1 and 2:** Consuming third-party consumer or enterprise applications; minimal responsibility.
  - **Scopes 3, 4, and 5:** Building custom AI solutions; increased responsibility for data and model management.

### 3. Responsibilities by Scope
- **Lower Scopes (1 & 2):**
  - Use third-party models with built-in data and functionality.
  - Minimal governance and compliance responsibilities.
- **Higher Scopes (3, 4, 5):**
  - Build and manage custom AI solutions.
  - Responsible for:
    - Data and model classification for risk
    - Threat modeling
    - Access control
    - Security controls implementation
    - Model endpoint resilience

### 4. Selecting AI Solutions
- Start with fully trained AI services if they meet requirements.
- If not, consider:
  - Pre-trained models (e.g., enhanced with retrieval augmented generation)
  - Models that can be fine-tuned with organizational data

### 5. Minimizing Scope and Responsibility
- Reducing the scope of AI customization minimizes responsibilities for:
  - Governance and compliance
  - Legal and privacy
  - Risk management
  - Security controls
  - Model resilience

### 6. Documenting AI Governance Policies
- Establish and document policies for:
  - Data governance
  - Access requests
  - Model transparency
- Align policies with required compliances and certifications.

### 7. Employee Training
- Train employees on their responsibilities based on job roles and access levels.

### 8. Monitoring and Review
- Define mechanisms to monitor:
  - AI system performance
  - Compliance
  - Bias
- Set actions based on pre-defined thresholds.
- Regularly review results and update policies to align with business goals and AI safety.
