# Governance and Compliance Regulations for AI Systems

## Data Governance Overview

Data governance is the combination of people, processes, and technology used to manage the availability, usability, integrity, and security of enterprise system data. Effective data governance ensures data consistency, trustworthiness, and prevents misuse.

### Major Components of Data Governance

1. **Curation**
    - Identifying and managing valuable data sources (databases, data lakes, data warehouses).
    - Limiting proliferation and transformation of critical data assets.
    - Ensuring data accuracy, freshness, and removal of sensitive information.

2. **Discovery and Understanding**
    - Enabling users to discover and comprehend data context.
    - Utilizing centralized data catalogs for easy data discovery and access requests.
    - Supporting confident, data-driven business decisions.

3. **Protection**
    - Balancing data privacy, security, and access.
    - Governing data across organizational boundaries with intuitive tools for both business and engineering users.

## Strategic Approach to Data Governance

- Treat data as a strategic asset.
- Develop competencies to use data effectively.
- Exercise authority and control to meet stakeholder expectations.
- Start with data domains necessary for targeted business initiatives.

## Data Governance Roles and Responsibilities

- **Data Owners**
    - Executive-level individuals responsible for data policy decisions, including regulatory and compliance policies.

    - Provide data stewards with necessary tools and capabilities.
    - Oversee systems that produce and consume data.

## Data Profiling, Cataloging, and Lineage

- **Data Profiling**
    - Systematic examination of data to detect issues and understand characteristics.
    - Supports data quality and compliance.

- **Data Catalog**
    - Ensures data availability for authorized users.
    - Facilitates data discovery and access management.

- **Data Lineage**
    - Tracks the origin, movement, transformation, and storage of data elements.
    - Provides transparency for data consumers regarding data sources and transformations.
