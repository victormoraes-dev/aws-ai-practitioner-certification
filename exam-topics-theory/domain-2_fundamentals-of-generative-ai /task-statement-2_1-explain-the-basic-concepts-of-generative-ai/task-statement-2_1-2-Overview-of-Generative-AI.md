# Task Statement 2.1: Explain the Basic Concepts of Generative AI

## Model Scale and Performance

- Larger models tend to perform better and require less in-context learning or further training.
- The development of highly scalable transformer architectures, access to vast training data, and powerful compute resources has enabled the creation of large models.
- Increasing model size improves capability but also increases training difficulty and cost.

## Pre-Training and Data

- Large Language Models (LLMs) develop a deep statistical representation of language during the pre-training phase.
- Pre-training uses vast amounts of unstructured data (gigabytes to petabytes) from diverse sources, including the internet and curated text corpora.
- The model learns language patterns and structures through self-supervised learning.
- Model weights are updated during pre-training to minimize the loss of the training objective.
- The encoder generates an embedding or vector representation for each token.
- Pre-training requires significant computational resources, typically using GPUs.
- Data collected from public sources must be processed for quality, bias mitigation, and removal of harmful content.
- Only a small percentage (1% to 3%) of tokens are used for pre-training after data curation.

## Modalities in Generative AI

- **Unimodal Models**: Work with a single data modality (e.g., text-to-text as in LLMs).
- **Multimodal Models**: Handle multiple data modalities (e.g., text, image, audio, video).
  - Enable cross-modal reasoning, translation, search, and content creation.
  - Examples of multimodal tasks:
    - Image captioning (generating text descriptions of images)
    - Visual question answering (answering questions about image content)
    - Text-to-image synthesis (generating images from text descriptions)

## Examples of Multimodal Generative AI

- Models such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney generate realistic images from natural language prompts.
- Multimodal generative AI is used in marketing, image captioning, product design, customer service, chatbots, and avatars.

## Diffusion Models

- Diffusion models are a class of generative models that learn to reverse a gradual noising process.
- They are used for tasks such as image generation, upscaling, and inpainting.
- **Key Components:**
  - Forward diffusion: Gradually adds noise to data.
  - Reverse diffusion: Iteratively removes noise to reconstruct data.
  - Stable diffusion: Operates in a reduced latent space rather than pixel space.
- The process starts with random noise and iteratively denoises it to produce coherent outputs (e.g., images, audio).
- The model predicts the noise added at each step, conditioned on the partially denoised output from the previous step.
- Diffusion models use Gaussian noise and a noise predictor with a reverse diffusion process.
- Stable diffusion models generate images from text using latent space representations.

## Advantages of Diffusion Models

- Produce higher quality, more diverse, and consistent outputs compared to generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs).
- More stable and easier to train.

## Examples of Diffusion Models

- **Stable Diffusion**: Image generation
- **Whisper**: Speech recognition and translation
- **AudioLM**: Audio generation

## Tools and Frameworks

- Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch provide modules for multimodal data.
- Pre-trained models like Stable Diffusion can be fine-tuned and deployed with minimal code.
