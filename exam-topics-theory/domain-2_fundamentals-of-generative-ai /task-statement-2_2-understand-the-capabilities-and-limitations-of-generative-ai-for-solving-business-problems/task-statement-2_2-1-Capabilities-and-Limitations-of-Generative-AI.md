# Task Statement 2.2: Understand the Capabilities and Limitations of Generative AI for Solving Business Problems

## Overview

Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) are general-purpose technologies with applications across various sectors of the economy. They offer significant advantages but also have important limitations that must be considered when solving business problems.

## Capabilities of Generative AI

- **Adaptability:** Can be applied to a wide range of tasks and industries.
- **Responsiveness:** Provides real-time or near real-time outputs for user queries.
- **Simplicity:** Reduces the complexity and cost of building AI applications compared to traditional AI systems.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Enables the development of valuable AI solutions at lower costs and with faster deployment times.
- **Broad Application:** Useful for tasks such as:
  - Text generation and summarization
  - Information extraction
  - Recommendation systems
  - Classification and moderation

## Limitations of Generative AI

- **Task-Specific Knowledge:** LLMs require relevant information to generate detailed and accurate outputs. Without specific data, outputs may be generic or lack detail.
- **Lack of Memory:** Each prompt is processed independently; the model does not retain memory of previous interactions unless specifically designed to do so.
- **Generalization:** While capable of handling many tasks, LLMs may not perform well on highly specialized or nuanced tasks without additional training or fine-tuning.
- **Responsible Use:** It is essential to ensure that generative AI is used ethically, responsibly, and fairly to benefit people and avoid harm.
- **Limitations in Reasoning:** LLMs may struggle with tasks that require deep reasoning or understanding beyond the information provided in the prompt.

## Practical Considerations

- When designing prompts for LLMs, consider whether the task is something a person with basic skills (e.g., a 10-year-old child) could perform with the given instructions and information.
- For tasks requiring specific knowledge or style, fine-tuning the model may be necessary to achieve desired results.
- Generative AI should be evaluated for its ability to solve the intended business problem while adhering to principles of responsible and ethical AI use.
