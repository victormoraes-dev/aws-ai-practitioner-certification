# Task Statement 2.2: Understand the Capabilities and Limitations of Generative AI for Solving Business Problems

## Model Selection Factors

When selecting generative AI models, consider the following factors:
- **Model type**
- **Performance**
- **Requirements**
- **Capabilities**
- **Constraints**
- **Compliance**

Choosing the correct model architecture is essential for the success of generative AI projects.

## Generative AI Model Architectures

Generative AI foundation models are designed to generate various types of content:
- Text and chat
- Images
- Code
- Video
- Embeddings

Models can be modified for specific domains and tasks by adjusting algorithms or model structures.

### Common Model Types

- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
- **Autoregressive Models**

Each model type has advantages and disadvantages depending on data complexity and quality.

Ongoing research continues to produce new and advanced generative models. The number and size of foundation models have grown rapidly, with dozens of models available since 2018.

## Business Metrics for Generative AI Applications

Key business metrics for generative AI applications include:
- Cross-domain performance
- Efficiency
- Conversion rate
- Average revenue per user
- Accuracy
- Customer lifetime value (CLTV)

Foundation models are trained on large, unlabeled datasets and serve as the baseline for developing generative AI applications. They are larger than traditional machine learning models and can interpret language, generate images, and support conversational messaging.

### Examples of Foundation Models

- **Stable Diffusion**: Image generation
- **GPT-4**: Natural language processing

## Evaluating Performance and Impact

Metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) are used to evaluate generative AI applications:
- **Accuracy**
- **Relevance**
- **Coherence**
- **Appropriateness**
- **User satisfaction**

Tracking and analyzing these metrics helps organizations learn from the past, monitor the present, and plan for the future.

## Integration and Operational Considerations

Foundation models must integrate with existing business systems and workflows, such as:
- Databases
- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

Organizations require:
- Employees with strong technical skills
- Computational resources and infrastructure
- Cost-effective deployment strategies

## Output Quality and Efficiency

Output quality is determined by:
- Relevance
- Accuracy
- Coherence
- Appropriateness

Efficiency can be measured by:
- Task completion rates
- Reduction in manual efforts
- Low error rates

These factors contribute to operational productivity and credibility.

## Return on Investment and Cost-Benefit Analysis

Organizations should evaluate:
- Potential return on investment (ROI)
- Operational costs
- Efficiencies gained

## Strategies to Maximize Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)

- Loyalty programs
- Brand loyalty initiatives
- Collecting customer feedback
- Cross-selling
- Personalized experiences

## Cross-Domain Performance

Metrics for cross-domain performance evaluate the transfer and application of knowledge and skills across different domains.

## Continuous Monitoring and Reevaluation

AI systems should be:
- Measured
- Monitored
- Reviewed
- Reevaluated

This ensures alignment with business requirements and goals.
