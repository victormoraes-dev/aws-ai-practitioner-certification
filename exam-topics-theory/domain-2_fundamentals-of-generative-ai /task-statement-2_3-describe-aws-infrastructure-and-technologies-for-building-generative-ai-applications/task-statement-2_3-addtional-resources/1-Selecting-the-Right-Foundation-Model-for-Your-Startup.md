# Selecting the Right Foundation Model for Your Startup

*This content was created based on the blog post from [ðŸ”— AWS Startups Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/startups/selecting-the-right-foundation-model-for-your-startup/)*

## Introduction

When startups build generative artificial intelligence (AI) into their products, selecting a foundation model (FM) is one of the first and most critical steps. A foundation model is a large machine learning (ML) model pre-trained on a vast quantity of data, adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. Model selection impacts user experience, go-to-market strategy, hiring, and profitability.

## Key Considerations

1. **Level of Customization**: Ability to change a modelâ€™s output ranging from prompt-based approaches to full model re-training.
2. **Model Size**: Defined by parameter count, indicating how much the model has learned.
3. **Inference Options**: Choices between self-managed deployment and API calls.
4. **Licensing Agreements**: Some agreements may restrict or prohibit commercial use.
5. **Context Windows**: Amount of information that can fit in a single prompt.
6. **Latency**: Time taken by a model to generate an output.

## Application-specific Benchmarks

Startups should establish a benchmark strategy to evaluate model performance. Custom benchmarking, like calculating BLEU and ROUGE scores, is crucial. Tools like Stanfordâ€™s [Holistic Evaluation of Language Models](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/) provide a generalized starting point.

## Rise of Smaller, Purpose-built Models

Startups are increasingly using smaller models specifically designed for tasks like instruction-following or summarization. For example, GoCharlie develops a marketing-specific model with 1B parameters, emphasizing the effectiveness of purpose-built models tailored to specific needs.

## Inference Flexibility

Consider how the model can be served. Open-source and self-managed proprietary models offer flexibility in hosting and infrastructure control, impacting reliability and cost-efficiency. AWS Graviton3 instances, for example, offer cost savings and reduced energy use.

## Conclusion

AWS offers flexibility in model selection and infrastructure setup, with services like [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) and [Amazon SageMaker JumpStart](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/jumpstart/) for foundation models and machine learning solutions.
